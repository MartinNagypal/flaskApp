<h1> Simple Flask App </h1>

<h2> What is the purpose of this project? </h2>
I watn to introduce myself to Flask so i can use it in future projects. This project is meant for me to play around with Flask, HTML, CSS and JS. 
Maybe i accidently develop some concepts wich i can use in later projects too. Trough this project i want to understand POST and GET requests, the usage of HTML templates and the communication from Flask to Javascript trough Api.
